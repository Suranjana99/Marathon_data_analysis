# Marathon Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains my first data analysis project that focuses on marathon race data. The analysis includes various metrics such as race times, distances, athlete performance, and event locations. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data to identify trends and patterns in marathon races worldwide.
